From Mat to Wuyin and me:

i put the replacement mpas-ocean files on cori in /global/cfs/cdirs/e3sm/maltrud/forNoel

they replace the files in components/mpas-source/src/core_ocean/analysis_members

i'm waiting to hear back from Karthik about exactly what he wants in the high frequency ocean stream.

Noel, can you please point me to a run directory where i can find the sea ice streams file that we will be using if nothing changes?  i want to send it to Andrew#.

there were no additions to the user_nl_mpaso and mpassi files in my test runs, so i think only cam, clm, and mosart need changes for the updated output.

was there anything else?  i jotted down notes but also feel like i've missed something#.
