The revised nudging code can be found at: https://github.com/E3SM-Project/E3SM/blob/jiansunpnnl/ms2019/components/cam/src/physics/cam/nudging.F90

The modifications mainly include:
1. The original nudging code only works appropriately when there is one time slice per data file. The revised code can work well with multiple time slices per data file.
2. The original nudging code only applies the step-function nudging. The revised code linearly interpolates the nudging data to each model time step. The difference can be viewed in Sun et al.'s JAMES paper.
3. Fix bugs to perform a real intermittent nudged simulation.
